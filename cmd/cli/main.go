package main

// TODO ``cli seed {env}``. Usage via `project db.seed`.
// use client (we want to use the highest abstraction possible for seeding, else we need to replicate db initialization, external connectins etc just for this cli)
// auth is no problem, just need to use admin api key env var (which also gets added as part of migrations).
