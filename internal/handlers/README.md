# Package `handlers`

## Instructions

Fill in all `api_*.go` files with your own handler implementations or add new
handler methods if necessary (e.g. fileserver endpoints cannot generated via ``openapi.yaml``).

## Notes

1. Do **not** rename or create new `api_*.go` files, except for `*_test.go`. You can safely create any other file that doesn't follow this pattern.
